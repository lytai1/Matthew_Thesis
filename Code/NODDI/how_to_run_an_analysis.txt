Inorder to run an analysis using the NODDI algorithm we must have a number of things:
1. The DTI of a patient. This includes: 
   a. a .nii.gz file containing the diffusion tensor image
   b. a bvec file containing the unit vectors of each specific run 
   c. a bval file containing the magnitude of each run
2. The standard template file. This can be found from FSL's flirt module files. This can be found under the 'template_dir' environment variable.
3. The run_analysis.sh file

To run the analysis we use the following command:

bash run_analysis.sh -d /path/to/the/patient.nii(.gz) -t /path/to/the/patient_T1.nii(.gz) -r /path/to/the/reference/file.nii(.gz) -p patient_num

This will open up a new job this is run by slurm. The output of the file should be a print out of the job number generated for the run
