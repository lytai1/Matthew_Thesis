# Thesis
This repository contains work related to the completion of my Masters thesis.

# Description
The topic of my thesis is `Detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment Using Diffusion Compartmental Imaging`. This repository 
contains all of the code and jupyter notebooks used in the project. The main code can be found in the NODDI folder found
in the `Code` folder.

# Requirements 
Inorder to run the pipeline `FSL` needs to be installed. Installation details can be found here: https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FslInstallation

The python requirements can be found
